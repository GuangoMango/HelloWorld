CPU MIPS design

This repo is intended to keep the MIPS CPU design proces from scratch:
Digital desing learning roadmap using "Digital design and computer architecture" book

Since I don't have all the basic knowledge in Verilog, web documentation is used to learn it.
- FPGA desing labs.

Code is downloaded into -back then- Terasic's DE1-SOC FPGA Dev Kit board.
